# Adam's Challah 

(All credit to our friend Adam, the world's best philosophizing-software-engineering-Puerto-Rican-Jewish-atheist baker)

## Ingredients

### For the sponge

- 1 packet or 1 tbsp active dry yeast
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 cup bread flour

### For the rest of the dough

- 2 large eggs at room temperature
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup honey (or sugar)
- 1 tsp salt
- 3-4 additional cups bread flour (you can optionally substitute up to 2 cups whole wheat flour)

### For the finish

- egg wash (1 egg beaten with a little water)
- (Optional) sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds and/or everything bagel seasoning
- (Optional) Raisins or chocolate chips

## Directions

### Make the sponge

(While you're doing this, take the eggs out of the fridge so they can come up to room temperature while the sponge is rising.)

In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in any large mixing bowl, if you will be kneading by hand) dissolve the yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in the warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes. Add the 1 cup of flour and whisk together to add a little air. Cover with plastic wrap and put aside for 1 to 2 hours (it will at least double in volume).

### Finish the dough

- Add the eggs, oil, honey, and salt to the sponge and mix lightly with a fork. 

- Add 3 cups of flour and mix again with a fork so the flour is all moistened. If you use a mixer, this will prevent the dreaded "mushroom cloud of flour" when you turn it on. Attach the bowl to your mixer and, using a dough hook attachment, knead the dough first at low, then medium speed for 3-4 minutes. If you're kneading by hand, knead for 8-10 minutes. The dough should be sticky, but not too wet (it will typically not be dry enough to pull completely from the sides of the bowl, as some other doughs do). Add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if it doesn't seem right.

- Cover the bowl again with plastic wrap (if you've hand kneaded, put the dough back in a clean bowl). Let the dough rise for another hour (or two, it's not too critical). It should about double in volume again in an hour, more if you let it rise for longer.

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

- Turn out the dough onto a floured cutting board. You may have to scrape the sides of the bowl to get all the dough out—I told you, it's a bit sticky! Form the dough into a loose ball and divide in two. I cut each half into three pieces, roll them with my hands into long snakes (8-12 inches long) and braid them together. If you're putting in raisins or chocolate chips, instead of rolling the pieces directly into snakes, make them into long rectangles and roll the sweet stuff up into long tubes.

- Place the braided challahs at least 3 inches apart on parchment paper on a large baking sheet. Cover lightly with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let sit for 20-30 minutes.

- Remove the plastic wrap and brush the loaves with the egg wash. 

- Sprinkle with toppings, if desired.

- Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the loaves are a nice color and sound a bit hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes before eating. 

- If you let them cool completely, they can be put in plastic bags and used the next day, or frozen and reheated later.

Sounds complicated, but it's actually quite an easy recipe once you've made it a couple of times and is very forgiving.

## Variants

The same dough will make

- 24 dinner rolls (baking time about 15-20 minutes)
- 16 hamburger buns (baking time 20-25 minutes)
- 1 large pan of cinnamon rolls (Make a rectangle of dough, top with butter, cinnamon and sugar, roll it up and slice. Lay the spirals in a greased baking dish, just touching, and top with more of the good stuff. Bake until they're done.)
