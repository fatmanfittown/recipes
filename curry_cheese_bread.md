# Simple Curry Cheese Bread

A highly simplified variant of the Curry-Cheese-Onion Bread from the Cheeseboard in Berkeley.

## Ingredients

 - 2 cups warm water
 - 4 cups plus a few tablespoons bread flour
 - 1 tbsp active dry yeast
 - 2 tsp kosher salt
 - 1 tbsp curry powder
 - 8 oz cheddar cheddar cheese in 1/2 inch cubes
 - a little corn meal for baking

## Directions

1. Whisk yeast into warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes.
2. Add flour, salt, and curry powder and stir with a fork until lightly mixed.
3. If you're using a stand mixer, use the dough hook to knead for a minute at medium speed. If the dough is too wet, add more flour, a little at a time, until it starts forming a loose ball around the dough hook. It should still be very slightly sticky to the touch. Keep kneading for 4-5 minutes at low speed, occasionally pulling the dough off the hook if it starts to climb. (Alternatively, knead by hand on a floured surface.)
4. Let the dough rise in the mixing bowl, lightly covered by a clean towel or plastic wrap, for 1-2 hours.
5. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Pull the dough into a circle or rectangly, sprinkle about 1/4 of the cheese on half of it, then fold the rest over. Pull out and fold 3 more times, adding another protion of the cheese each time. You may need to let the dough rest for 5-10 minutes between a couple of the folds if it tightens up too much to manipulate.
6. Form the dough into a loose ball and let rest, covered lightly, for 30 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 450F while the dough is resting.
8. Sprinkle corn meal on a baking sheet (with or without parchment paper).
9. Gently place the dough ball on the corn meal. Make a few shallow (no more than an inch) cuts into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.
10. Bake for 45 minutes. The loaf should sound a little hollow when you tap the bottom.

Variations/enhancements

  - Put an oven-safe skillet or pot of water into the oven while preheating to generate some steam, and leave it in while baking
   - Alternatively, bake in a Dutch oven or other tightly covered heavy pot. Preheat the utensil in the oven before you put the corn meal and dough into it.
   - Cut the dough into smaller loaves. Adjust baking time accordingly.
   - Cut the dough into 2 oz pieces (should be 16-20 for this recipe). Form into disks and cook in a dry, heavy skillet, dusted with corn meal, on medium-high heat for about 8 minutes, flipping halfway through, to make English muffins.
