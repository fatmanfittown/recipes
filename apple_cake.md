# Jewish Apple Cake

## INGREDIENTS

- 3 c. all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 2 c white sugar
- 1 c vegetable oil
- 4 eggs
- 1/4 c orange juice (I like to use frozen concentrate)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 Granny Smith or similar apples - peeled, cored and sliced
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 5 tsp white sugar

## DIRECTIONS:

Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan. Combine the ground cinnamon and 5 teaspoons of the sugar together and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder and 2 cups of the sugar. Stir in the vegetable oil, beaten eggs, orange juice and vanilla. Mix well.
Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Top with 1/2 of the sliced apples and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar mixture. Pour the remaining batter over the top and layer the remaining sliced apples and cinnamon sugar.
Bake for 70 to 90 minutes.
