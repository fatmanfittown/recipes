Basic Flatbread

Dough:

    2 cups lukewarm water
    4-5 cups bread flour
    1 tablespoon (or 1 packet) active dry yeast
    2 teaspoons kosher salt

Topping(s):
    kosher salt
    za'atar
    sesame seeds
    finely chopped onions, sauteed until slightly soft
    herbs
    
olive oil for baking

Prepare dough:

    Dissolve yeast in the warm water and let stand 5 minutes. Mix in 4 cups of the flour and the salt. Use a dough hook on a mixer or knead by hand. Add flour a little at a time until the dough forms a soft but springy ball. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and let stand until doubled--about an hour. Punch down the dough and let rise a second time.
    
    Preheat oven to 425F. 
    
    Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead it for a couple of minutes until it tightens up and gets elastic, then let it rest for a few minutes.
    
    Generously cover baking sheets with good olive oil. Cut the dough ball into 4 pieces. Stretch each piece into a flat circle, approximately 1/2 inch thick--it can be thinner in the middle with a thicker rim; basically, a pizza crust. Place them on the oiled sheets, then flip them over so they are completely oiled on both sides. 
    
    Sprinkle with your choice of topping and kosher salt to taste.
    
    Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pans in the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes until crisp and browned slightly on the bottom.
    
    Serve fresh from the oven or store for 2-3 days in a plastic bag and toast before eating. Freezes well--thaw, then reheat in the oven or a toaster oven.
    
Variations: 

    1) replace up to 1/2 of the bread flour with whole wheat flour.
    2) make the rounds into pizzas
