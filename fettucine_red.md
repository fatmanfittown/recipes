# Fettucine with Tomato Sauce

One of my you-just-learned-this-technique-after-50-years-of-cooking? recipes. Inspired by a similar thing I heard on the New Yorker podcast.

**Requires two pots!**

## Ingredients

1 package dried long pasta (fettucine, spaghetti, etc)

1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, chopped or sliced thin (more if you like it garlicky)
1 can tomato paste
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (optional)
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
whatever dried or fresh herbs you like, to taste
olive oil
1-2 tablespoons butter

# Instructions

In one large pot, prepare pasta as directed, but do not cook completely. It should still be very slightly crunchy inside.

In the other large pot, saute the onions in olive oil until well-done, getting a little dark on the edges. Add garlic, reduce heat, and cook for a minute or two more, stirring constantly. Add crushed red pepper, tomato, and tomato paste. Put in herbs now if they're dried. Keep stirring constantly so the mixture doesn't burn. It'll be fairly dense and a bit dry. Turn it off if the pasta isn't ready yet. The goal is to have the pasta ready at about the same time this is done.

Transfer drained, slightly undercooked pasta to the sauce pot, along with 1-2 cups of the pasta cooking water. Add fresh herbs at this point, if you're using them. Stir constantly until the pasta finishes cooking in the sauce (3-4 minutes). Add butter as it's finishing. 

Serve topped with parmesan.


In the recipe that inspired this, they added a little anchovy to the sauce initially, and put riced (finely chopped) cauliflower into the sauce during the saute.
