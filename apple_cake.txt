Jewish Apple Cake

INGREDIENTS:

3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/4 cup orange juice ( I like to use frozen concentrate)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 apples - peeled, cored and sliced (Granny Smith's)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
5 teaspoons white sugar

DIRECTIONS:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan. Combine the ground cinnamon and 5 teaspoons of the sugar together and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder and 2 cups of the sugar. Stir in the vegetable oil, beaten eggs, orange juice and vanilla. Mix well.
Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Top with 1/2 of the sliced apples and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar mixture. Pour the remaining batter over the top and layer the remaining sliced apples and cinnamon sugar.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 70 to 90 minutes.
